TOPIC: Databricks Setup, Clusters, Notebooks, and DBFS
Databricks Community Edition provides an environment for running analytics workloads using compute clusters and notebooks, with data storage managed by the Databricks File System (DBFS).
5 Key Learning Points
1. Registration Requirement: When signing up for the Databricks Community Edition, users must use an external email address (such as Gmail or Outlook). This is necessary because there is a reported issue in being able to sign up using a student account.
2. Compute Cluster Necessity: After logging in to the dashboard, a compute cluster must be created and named. This resource is essential because analytics workloads cannot be executed without an underlying compute resource attached to the notebook.
3. Notebook Function: The primary location for running code and carrying out an analytics workload is within a notebook.
4. DBFS Utility Command: The Databricks File System (DBFS) directories are enumerated (listed) using the dbutils.fs.ls library command. For example, display(dbutils.fs.ls('/')) enumerates the root directory.
5. Accessing Sample Data: Databricks provides a set of sample databases that can be enumerated using the dbutils.fs.ls command targeted at the specific path: /databricks-datasets/.

3 Common Cluster or DBFS Errors and Why They Happen
Error Scenario
Cause
Source Reference
Failed Sign Up/Email Verification
The user attempted registration using a student email account. The workshop specifically advises using an external email address due to an ongoing issue with student account sign-up.

Notebook Workload Execution Failure
The user failed to create a compute cluster or failed to attach it to their notebook. A cluster is necessary to run the code required for an analytics workload.

DBFS Listing Error
The user attempted to list directories using an incorrect utility or misspelled the command. Directory listing requires the specific Databricks utility, dbutils.fs.ls, applied to the relevant path (e.g., /).
